          <p>Human tendency has always remained dynamic and has led to various revolutions for mankind. Nineteenth century was the era of machine revolution, twentieth century was the era of electronic revolution but the 21st century is time of Computing and Information Technology (CIT) revolution. The peculiar thing with CIT revolution is that it is globalized while earlier revolutions belonged only to some countries. CIT is touching each and every walk of life. Now every field of life such as industrial, rural development, medical, economical, even social field are looking forward for help from CIT for their survival and growth. <br></br>
            CIT in itself consists of wide range of possibilities which are increasing exponentially day by day. To cope up with increasing global need for high performance, more efficiency, and optimized output; advance computing technologies are the growing research area in the field of CIT. Although various high performance models such as cluster computing, Grid computing and cloud computing have been proposed but these models are still looking for big hands in research. So, Advance Computing has been one of the most promising research areas throughout the globe for some decades now. With this thought in mind, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh (India) has planned to bring together the Advance Computing research community through 1st IEEE International Conference on Advanced Computing and Emerging Technologies (ACET-2024), 23-24 August 2024. <br></br>
            ACET-2024 is being organized with the objective of bringing together researchers, developers, and practitioners from academia and industry working in the area of advance computing and technologies. ACET-2024 aims to provide an international and interdisciplinary forum for the Computer Science and Technology research community to explore the frontier of science and technology in advanced computing, emerging technologies, data science, machine learning, deep learning, and intelligent machines. English is the official language of the conference
